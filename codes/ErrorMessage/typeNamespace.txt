"CSharp Error - "Type or namespace definition, or end-of-file expected""

This error message in C# typically occurs when the compiler encounters a problem with the syntax of your code. It can mean that there is a missing closing brace or parenthesis, or that you have forgotten to close a string or comment.

To fix this error, you should carefully check your code for any missing or mismatched syntax. Make sure that all opening braces and parentheses have matching closing braces and parentheses, and that all strings and comments are properly closed.

Additionally, make sure that all namespaces and class definitions are properly formatted and terminated. If you are still having trouble, try compiling your code in smaller sections to isolate the problem.
