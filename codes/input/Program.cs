            In C#, "input" refers to the data or information that a user provides to a program while it is running. This input can be provided through various sources such as the keyboard, mouse, or external devices.

            In order to read input from the user in a C# program, you can use the "Console.ReadLine()" method. This method waits for the user to type a line of text and press the Enter key, and then returns the text that was entered as a string.
        */

        // Here's an example of using "Console.ReadLine()" to read input from the user:
        Console.WriteLine("Please enter your name:");
        string name = Console.ReadLine();
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, " + name + "!");

        // In this example, the program prompts the user to enter their name, and then reads their input using "Console.ReadLine()". The user's name is then stored in the "name" variable and used to display a personalized greeting.
        Console.WriteLine("Please enter a number:");
        int num1 = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());

        Console.WriteLine("Please enter another number:");
        int num2 = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());

        int result = num1 + num2;

        Console.WriteLine("The sum of the two numbers is: " + result);

        /*
            In this program, the user is prompted to enter two numbers using "Console.ReadLine()". The input is then parsed into integers using the "int.Parse()" method and stored in variables called "num1" and "num2".

            The program then adds the two numbers together and stores the result in a variable called "result". Finally, the program displays the result using "Console.WriteLine()".

            Note that this program assumes that the user enters valid integer values. If the user enters non-integer values or values that are too large or small to be stored as integers, the program will throw an exception. It's a good idea to include error handling code to handle these cases in a more robust program.
