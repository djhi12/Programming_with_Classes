using System;

class Program {
    /*
        In C#, the statement "using System" is used to import the namespace called "System" into your code. The System namespace provides access to a number of fundamental classes and base types that are commonly used in C# programming.

        For example, the System namespace contains classes like Console, which provides basic input/output functionality, and DateTime, which represents a date and time value. By importing the System namespace using the "using" keyword, you can use these classes in your code without having to specify the full namespace each time you reference them.
    */

    /*
        In addition to the "System" namespace, C# provides a number of other namespaces that contain classes and types for various purposes. Here are a few examples:

        "System.Collections": This namespace provides classes for working with collections of objects, such as arrays, lists, and dictionaries.

        "System.IO": This namespace provides classes for working with input and output operations, such as reading and writing files and streams.

        "System.Net": This namespace provides classes for working with network protocols and communications, such as TCP/IP, HTTP, and FTP.

        "System.Threading": This namespace provides classes for working with threads and synchronization, such as creating and managing threads and locking resources.

        "System.Xml": This namespace provides classes for working with XML documents and data, such as parsing and generating XML, and transforming XML with XSLT.

        These are just a few examples of the many namespaces available in C#. Depending on the type of application you are building, you may need to use one or more of these namespaces, or even create your own custom namespaces for your code.
