// In C#, "Console.ReadLine()" is a method used to read input from the user through the console window. It waits for the user to enter a line of text and press the Enter key, and then returns the text that was entered as a string.


// Here's an example of using "Console.ReadLine()" to read input from the user:
Console.WriteLine("Please enter your name:");
string name = Console.ReadLine();
Console.WriteLine("Hello, " + name + "!");

/*
    In this example, the program prompts the user to enter their name using "Console.WriteLine()". The "Console.ReadLine()" method then waits for the user to enter a line of text and press Enter. The text that was entered is stored in a variable called "name".

    The program then uses string concatenation to display a personalized greeting to the user using "Console.WriteLine()".

    Note that the "Console.ReadLine()" method returns a string, which means that any input entered by the user will be treated as text. If you need to read numerical input from the user, you will need to convert the string to a numeric data type using methods such as "int.Parse()" or "double.Parse()".
