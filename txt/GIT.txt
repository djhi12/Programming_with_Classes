Git is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to manage the development of the Linux kernel. Git allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously and tracks changes made by each individual. It provides features such as branching and merging, which allow developers to work on different features and merge changes back into a single codebase.

Git is typically used through a command-line interface, but there are also many graphical user interfaces available. Some popular Git hosting platforms include GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. These platforms provide a central location for storing and sharing Git repositories and offer collaboration features such as pull requests, code reviews, and issue tracking.

Git uses a decentralized approach, which means that each developer has a complete copy of the codebase on their local machine. This allows developers to work independently and make changes without requiring constant communication with other team members. When changes are ready to be shared, they can be pushed to a central repository, where other team members can pull them down and incorporate them into their own local copies of the code.

Overall, Git has become an essential tool for software development and has revolutionized the way teams collaborate on code. Its flexibility, speed, and powerful branching and merging capabilities have made it a popular choice for projects of all sizes.
